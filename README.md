Current Version
Hey! This is the MVP version of this concept, so it works in the basic sense, but still has some kinks and bugs to workout.

Play the game with a friend or two here:

You can also pull the docker image from my dockerhub @coffeegoddd,
or clone this repo to run the app locally.

To run locally:

clone repo, then in the repos root directory:

$ npm install && npm run install:all

then go to client/src/components/App.jsx and uncomment line 40, and comment out line 43.

then type,
$ npm run start:all

should start application on the port 3111.
